<Step>Install the following dependencies:</Step>

```bash
npm install react-aria-components
```

<Step>Copy and paste the following code into your project.</Step>

<Callout>
    This component has a temporary workaround to make button works on radix-ui primitives. Mainly to be compatible with some radix-ui components that are yet supported by react-aria-components. Feel free to delete them if you don't need radix-ui primitives.
</Callout>

<ComponentSource name="button" />

<Step>Update the import paths to match your project setup.</Step>

</Steps>

## Events

Button supports user interactions via mouse, keyboard, and touch. You can handle all of these via the onPress prop. This is similar to the standard onClick event, but normalized to support all interaction methods equally. In addition, the onPressStart, onPressEnd, and onPressChange events are fired as the user interacts with the button.

Each of these handlers receives a `PressEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction. See [usePress](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/usePress.html) for more details.

## Usage

```tsx
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

```tsx
<Button variant="outline">Button</Button>
```

## Link

The Button component always represents a button semantically. To create a link that visually looks like a button, you can use the `buttonVariants` helper to create a link that looks like a button. Note that it only works in client component!

```tsx
import { buttonVariants } from "@/components/ui/button"
```

```tsx
<Link className={buttonVariants({ variant: "outline" })}>Click here</Link>
```
